# VisualizeDataWithATreemapDiagram

## Version

- V1:
	- For each game, I display a square with a size related to the amount of sale.
	- For each game, I display the name of the game in the square with the amount of sales.
	- It should be organised per platform.
	- I don't take care of the color.
	- I don't show the tooltip.
	- The legend is not showed.

- V2:
	- Add the title headers. _(link 7)_
	- each platform has a specific color.
	- A tooltip is integrated.
